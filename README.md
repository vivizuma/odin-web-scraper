# Odin Project Web Scraper

## Gets all current "Knowledge Test" questions from the Odin Project course

I would like to:
-convert all collected data to a .md file
-order the data in the correct order
-- to do this I would need to scrape through the particular course overview pages and then match and order
---- this will be inefficient if i chose the incorrect data structures and algorithms
